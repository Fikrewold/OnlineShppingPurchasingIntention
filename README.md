Context
Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. This is a transactional data set that contains all the transactions occurring in online retail. Ecommerce data contains information relating to the visitors and performance of an online shop. It's mostly used by marketers e.g. in understanding consumer behavior and enhancing conversion funnels.

Objective
The objective is to find out the features which have the most information context to differentiate the positive class and negative class and also build a model to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not.
